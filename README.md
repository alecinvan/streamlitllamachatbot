# streamlitllamachatbot
Combine llama2 models and streamlit to create a simple chatbot.


Downloading Llama2 models of different sizes from Huggingface, loading to Replicate to generate the Inference APIs. Applying streamlit to produce a WEBUI to take Replicate API tokens and prompts, interacting with Llama2 via Replicate APIs.

The very basic version of chatbot, but work as a reference for future chatbot applications.
